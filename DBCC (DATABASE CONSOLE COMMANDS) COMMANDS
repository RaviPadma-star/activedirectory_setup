> DBCC commands are used to check the consistency of the database or database objects.
While executing DBCC commands the DB engine creates a database snapshot and then runs the
checks against this snapshot. After the DBCC command is completed, this snapshot is dropped.

MAINTENANCE COMMANDS:
Perform the maintenance tasks on a database, index, or filegroup.
CLEANTABLE:
> Reclaims space from dropped variable-length columns in tables or indexed views.
DBCC CLEANTABLE (‘Database name’, ‘Table name’, size)


DBREINDEX:
> Rebuilds one or more indexes for a table in the specified database.
DBCC DBREINDEX (‘Table name’, ‘Index name’, Fill factor)


DROPCLEANBUFFERS:
> Removes all clean buffers from the buffer pool.
DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS

FREEPROCCACHE:
> Removes all elements from the plan cache, removes a specific plan from the plan cache by
specifying a plan handle or SQL handle, or removes all cache entries associated with a specified
resource pool.
DBCC FREEPROCCACHE

INDEXDEFRAG:
> Defragments indexes of the specified table or view.
DBCC INDEXDEFRAG (‘Database name’,’Table name’,’index name, partition number’)


SHRINKDATABASE:
> Shrinks the size of the data and log files in the specified database.
DBCC SHRINKDATABASE (‘Database name’, target percentage)

SHRINKFILE:
> Shrinks the size of the specified data or log file for the current database, or empties a file by
moving the data from the specified file to other files in the same filegroup, allowing the file to
be removed from the database. You can shrink a file to a size that is less than the size specified
when it was created. This resets the minimum file size to the new value.

DBCC SHRINKFILE (‘File name’, target percentage)

INFORMATIONAL COMMANDS:
Performs tasks that gather and display various types of information.
CONCURRENCYVIOLATION:
> Is maintained for backward compatibility. It runs but returns no data.
DBCC CONCURRENCYVIOLAION

PROCCACHE:
> Displays information in a table format about the procedure cache.
DBCC PROCCACHE
SHOW_STATISTICS:
> Displays the current distribution statistics for the specified target on the specified table.


DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS (table or index view name’, target)

SHOWCONTIG:
> Displays fragmentation information for the data and indexes of the specified table or view.
DBCC SHOWCONTIG (‘table name’)


SQLPERF:
> Provides the transaction log space usage statistics for all databases. It can also be used to
reset wait and latch statistics.
DBCC SQLPERF (LOGSPACE)

TRACESTATUS:
> Display the status of trace flags.

VALIDATION COMMANDS:
> Performs validation operations on a database, table, index, catalog, filegroup, or allocation of
database pages.

DBCC CHECKCATALOG (‘Database name’)


CHECKCONSTRAINTS:
> Checks the integrity of a specified constraint or all constraints on a specified table in the
current database.
DBCC CHECKCONSTRAINTS WITH ALL_CONSTRAINTS
CHECKDB:
> Checks the logical and physical integrity of all the objects in the specified database.
DBCC CHECKDB (‘Database name)



CHECKFILEGROUP:
> Checks the allocation and structural integrity of all tables and indexed views in the specified
