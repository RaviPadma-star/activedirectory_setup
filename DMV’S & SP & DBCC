DMV’S [DYNAMIC MANAGEMENT VIEWS]

Locks:
Select * from Sys.dm_tran_locks:
Returns information about locks


Blockings:
Select * from sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks:

Sys.dm_os_wait_stats:
> Returns information about all the waits encountered by threads that executed. You can use
this aggregated view to diagnose performance issues with SQL Server and also with specific
queries and batches.


2. Database Related DMV’S:
Mirroring:
1. Sys.dm_db_mirroring_auto_page_repair:
1. Returns a row for every automatic page-repair attempt on any mirrored database on the
server instance.
2. This view contains rows for the latest automatic page-repair attempts on a given mirrored
database, with a maximum of 100 rows per database.
2. Sys.dm_db_mirroring_connections:
Returns a row for each connection established for database mirroring.


3. INDEX related DMV’S
Fragmentation: DMV's to find 2005 onwards
1. Select * from sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats:
To find Column to verify the fragmentation value:
Avg_fragementaion_in_pernt:

Missing Index:
Select * from sys.dm_db_missing_index_details:


sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats:
Returns counts of different types of index operations and the time each type of operation was
last performed in SQL Server.


5. Replication related DMV’S:

Sys.dm_repl_articles:
> Returns information about database objects published as articles in a replication topology.
Sys.dm_repl_tranhash:
> Returns information about transactions being replicated in a transactional publication.
Sys.dm_repl_schemas:
> Returns information about table columns published by replication.
Sys.dm_repl_traninfo:
> Returns information on each replicated or change data capture transaction.


********************************STORED PROCEDURES IN SQL SERVER

A stored procedure is a group of Sql statements that has been created and stored in the
database. Stored procedure will accept input parameters so that a single procedure can be used
over the network by several clients using different input data. Stored procedure will reduce
network traffic and increase the performance. If we modify stored procedure all the clients will
get the updated stored procedure
In SQL we are having different types of stored procedures are there
a) System Stored Procedures
b) User Defined Stored procedures
c) Extended Stored Procedures
System Stored Procedures:
System stored procedures are stored in the master database and these are 
starts with
a sp_ prefix. These procedures can be used to perform variety of tasks to support Sql server
functions for external application calls in the system tables and use to perform many
administrative and informational activities.

Ex: sp_helptext [StoredProcedure_Name]


User Defined Stored Procedures:
User Defined stored procedures are usually stored in a user database and are typically designed
to complete the tasks in the user database. While coding these procedures don’t
use sp_ prefix because if we use the sp_ prefix first it will check master database then it comes
to user defined database
Stored procedure are modules or routines that encapsulate code for reuse. A stored procedures
can take input parameters, return tabular or scalar results and messages to the client.
Extended Stored Procedures:
Extended stored procedures are the procedures that call functions from DLL files that an
instance of Microsoft SQL Server can dynamically load and run. Now a day’s extended stored
procedures are depreciated for that reason it would be better to avoid using of Extended Stored
procedures.
Why use Stored Procedures?
> Rewriting inline SQL statements as Stored Procedures
> Compilation and storing of the query execution plan
> Enabling of conditional and procedural logic
> Centralized repository for DML and DDL code enabling code reuse
> Protection from SQL Injection attacks
> Enabling of strict security model
> Readability
