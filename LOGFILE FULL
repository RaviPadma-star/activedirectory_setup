Log file full:
Error: 9002
Steps:
1. By using select * from sys.databases and verify the column "log_reuse_wait_desc" to find any
active transactions are there?
DBCC SQLPERF (Logspace)
2. Check whether log file growth is set to restricted or unrestricted?
If set restricted then increase the size for log file growth.
3. Verify whether log backups are running or not if not manually run one T-log backup.
4. Try to perform SHRINK operation which can release the space.
5. Check the disk space availability where you kept log file
6. If disk space is not available then add the over_flow file into the disk where space is available.

7. Perform file movement after approval to the disk where it have enough free space.
8. Verify whether log backups are running or not if not manually run one T-log backup.


Last option:
TRUNCATE ONLY ;;;( Not recommended in production server)
Backup log dbname with truncate_only
Note: VLF'S deleted from log file and due to truncate operation. You may get the free space in
log file but chances of data loss.
