> The main purpose of this tool is to provide recommendations to improve the query
performance by analysis the query [work load file] on a table in the database.
> Database tuning advisor can analyze the performance effects of workloads run against one or
more databases or a SQL profiler trace (they may contain T-SQL batch or remote procedure call).
After analyzing, it recommends to add, remove or modify physical design structure such as
clustered and non-clustered indexes, indexed views and portioning.
Workload: a work load is set of transact-SQL statements that executes against databases you
want to tune.
Steps:
• Open DTA tool
• Save the query as file
• Provide the path for work load file
• Select the database
• Start analysis.


Note: After analysis DTA provides recommendations and then implement always on test server
first. Check the performance and after implement on prod system.
From DTA reports> statement cost report > Value have to check to know how much percentage
of query faster.


Example:
Create table [Table] (userID varchar (55), FirstName nvarchar (55), Lastname nvarchar (55))
; With sequence as (
Select N = row_number () over (order by @@spid)
from sys.all_columns c1, sys.all_columns c2
)
Insert into [Table] (UserID, FirstName, Lastname)
Select
'UserID' + right ('000000' + cast (N as varchar (10)), 6),
'John' + right ('000000' + cast (N as varchar (10)), 6),
'Doe' + right ('000000' + cast (N as varchar (10)), 6)
from sequence where N <= 100000
Select * from [Table] where Lastname='Doe299999'




How to clear the buffers:
DBCC FREEPROCCACHE
GO
DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS
GO
DBCC FREESYSTEMCACHE ('ALL')
GO
DBCC FREESESSIONCACHE


Note:
Never clear buffer until proper confirmation from application team.
Statistics: Mainly it contains table updated information and density value information.
Whenever we update table then statistics also updated.
Note: By default AUTO statistics option is always true in each database.
Drop statistics DBO. [Table]. [_WA_Sys_00000003_0F975522]
Drop statistics DBO. [Table]. [_WA_Sys_00000001_0F975522]




ACID PROPERTIES
What is Transaction?
Transaction is a set of logical unit of work and it contains one or more database operations. A
valid transaction should be met (ACID) Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability properties.
Atomicity: A transaction must be an automatic unit of work, either all of it data modification are
performed or none of them is performed.
Consistency: When completed a transaction must leave all data in consistent state. In a
relational database, all rules must be applied to transactions modifications to maintain all data
integrity. All internal data structures, such as B-tree indexes (or) doubled linked lists must be
correct at end of transaction.
Isolation: Modifications made by concurrent transaction must be isolated from the
modifications made by the other consequent transactions. A transaction either sees a data in
the state it was in before another concurrent transaction modified it, (or) sees the data after
second transaction completed.
Durability: After a transaction has completed, its effects are permanently in place in the system.
The modification persists even in the event of a system failure.
