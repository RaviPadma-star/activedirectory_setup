now customer asking on server level for high avalibility,
cluster is a instance level or server level feature
there is no data sync in the cluster level
in cluster will call as resources
--> group of resources
clustering is one to many
clustering is a automatic fail over
all resources will move to on secondary node


--> primary node is called active node
--> secondary node is called as passive node

on which node is running is called active node

--> if one app (sql server) is running cluster setup that is called active passive node
--> if multiple application (sql server) are running on the multiple nodes that is called active active setup

--> there is a private communiton b/w all the nodes with the help of heartbeat
--> heartbeat is ntg but but a private communication b/w the nodes which will happen every 5 seconds
--> in cluster we have quorum this is act has a master in cluster setup
quorum will decide who is the next secondary node
--> how to make active-active to active-passive with the help of failover

cluster -setup -pre-req

--> windows server failover cluster (wsfc)
--> sql server failover cluster (ssfc)
--> failover ckuster instance (fci)

lets setup: 

we need to enable the 2 adapater for each server

in sql we have to types of installation
1. standlone
2. cluster level

for first server we select the new sql server cluster insatllatiom
for second server we select the add node to cluster


in server configuration we select the service account for :1 sql server database 2. sql server agent   startup type should be manual imp

in database engine select current user and service account as well

what is preffered ownwer and possile owner
--> if customer is saying the application are running slowly, execution is very slow
--> immedialte will check outlook any teams or windows or network upgrading I yes then go to cluster check preferred owner of node
--> go to failover wizard select sql server in bottom we can see summary, resources and go to resource tab go to other resource right click advanced tab we able to nodes


where we can see the error--> information details, cluster events, dependency report

preferred owner means application can run on aparticular node on cluster setup
but still there will be a preferred owner, among this nodes if we have 3 nodes cluser setup application out of this 3 nodes 1 node will be preffered node, then resource like run smoothly because of available more resources

possible owners--> in case of failover that node should be in the possiblw owner list then only you can failover, if not it is not possible to failover

how many ip we need to config sql clusterfor 2 nodes
1 public
heartbeat node 1
public node2
heartbeat node 2
windows cluster 1
sql cluster ip

formula -> 2n + 1 + no of sql application

when any thing goes wrong we need to run validation cluster or view validation report
this is a downtime activity


there are some error threshold limit and network error
