[User db corruption]
Suspect is a state where database becomes inaccessible due to different reasons

Reasons:
1) Data and Log files missing or corrupt
2) Corruption of pages in the Data and Log files.
3) Synchronization issues between data and log files
4) Issues that are caused during Recovery/Restoring process
5) Sudden shutdown happen to your database\instance...
6) Kill spid while transaction is roll back...
7) Database Flags in inactive status.


Case 1: LDF File corruption

Steps to Resolve:
1) Identify if database is really in suspect state or not

Select databasepropertyex ('dbname','status')

2) Attempt to reset the suspect flag using sp_resetstatus  --> sp_resetstatus 'amershopdata'

3) Set the EMERGENCY mode on for the database for further troubleshooting. Emergency mode
is a READ_ONLY state and gives some base for identifying the cause of the issue.
Alter database dbname set emergency

4) Put database in Single User mode, to avoid connection conflicts.
Alter database <Dbname> set Single_user with rollback immediate

5) Run DBCC CHECKDB on the database to identify if the issue is with Data files or Log files.
Running checkdb finds any consistency and allocation errors and if there are no errors found
then Data file is considered to be clean. The issue might exist with Log file.

Output should say:
CHECKDB found 0 allocation errors and 0 consistency errors in database 'test'.
6) Detach the database and delete log file from the path.
sp_detach_db @dbname='dbname'

7) After attach database by using below cmd:
CREATE DATABASE databasename on
(FILENAME = N'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.2\MSSQL\Data\databasename
.mdfâ€™) for attach
Finally database come online with new ldf file.
Inform apps team to test the data from their end.


Case 2: If data file corrupt?
Restore from recent backup file
Note: If .mdf corrupt db will not go to emergency mode...

Case 3: If page corrupt?
Restore from recent backup file by using below cmd
Restore database dbname page= (file id: pageid) from disk='backup file path'

Note:
[Late recovery Option: Client approval is required]
If backup is not available and issues found with data file/log file use
DBCC Checkdb ('dbname', REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS)
This command repairs the database but has the risk of data loss. Take proper approvals before
performing this step.
Note: Your system databases never go to suspect mode.

Background about CHECK DB
If you run checkdb what are the internal queries will execute?
Checks the logical and physical integrity of all the objects in the specified database by
performing the following operations:
>> Runs DBCC CHECKALLOC on the database:: Checks the consistency of disk space allocation
structures for a specified database.
>> Runs DBCC CHECKTABLE on every table and view in the database::Checks the integrity of all
the pages and structures that make up the table or indexed view.
>> Runs DBCC CHECKCATALOG on the database::Checks for catalog consistency within the
specified database. The database must be online.
Note: IN SUSPECT MODE NOT POSSIBLE TO APPLY TAIL LOG BACKUP
