1. HOW MANY AGENTS ARE IN EACH TYPE OF REPLICATION?
Snapshot Replication: Snapshot agent, distributor agent
Transactional Replication: Snapshot agent, distributor agent, Log reader agent
Transaction with updatable subscription: Snapshot agent, distributor agent, log reader, queue reader
agent.
Merge Replication: Snapshot agent, distributor agent, merge agent
Peer to Peer Replication: Snapshot agent, distributor agent, and log reader agent [Per each peer or
node]
2. HOW TO ADD AND DELETE ARTICLE IN EXISTING REPLICATION? WHAT IS DIFF BETWEEN
2000, 2005 AND 2008 ADDING ARTICLE PROCESS?
Adding article

1. Take full database backup for publisher database
2. Take the scripts in publisher and subscriber for create and drop scripts.[Purpose: like a backup of
existing replication configuration]
3. After go to publisher >>>Publisher database properties>>and article>>and select that article.
4. Renationalize the snap shot again from replication monitor: to replicate newly added article from
publisher to subscriber


Through query:
SP_addartical [sp used to add article]

Example: EXEC SP_addartical
@publication = Pub_dbAmericasCitrixFarm,
@article = Table_2,
@source object = Table_2



Removal of article:
1. Take full database backup for publisher database
2. Take the scripts in publisher and subscriber for create and drop scripts.
3. After go to publisher >>>Publisher database properties>>and article>>and uncheck that
article.
4. Renationalize the snap shot again from replication monitor.
Example:
EXEC sp_dropsubscription
@publication = Pub_dbAmericasCitrixFarm,
@article = N'Table_2',
@subscriber = 'FTDCCWPCTRXSQL';


3. SCHEMA CHANGES IF WE DO ANY IMPACT TO SUBSCRIBER?
If we perform any schema changes to the existing replicated article, then we need to re initialize
snapshot from publisher one more time.


4. REMOVAL OF REPLICATION?
Method 1:
Go to the publication >replication> "Disable publishing and distribution" option>click next and
finish
Automatically delete distribution database. After go to local publication delete publication and
subscription from local subscriber.
Method 2:
Exec sp_droppublication ‘publication name’
Exec sp_dropsubscription’subscriptoon name’


5. DISTRIBUTION DATABASE REMOVAL AND IS IT POSSIBLE TO TAKE DISTRIBUTION DATABASE
OFFLINE?
Method 1: Go to distribution server>right click> disable publishing and distribution> remove
distribution database.
Method 2: Remove dependent publisher and subscriber
After fire drop database distribution (at distribution server)


6. DMV’S [DYNAMIC MANAGEMENT VIEW] USED FOR REPLICATION:
1. Sys.dm_repl_articles: Returns information about database objects published as articles in a
replication topology.
2. Sys.dm_repl_schemas: Returns information about table columns published by replication.
3. Sys.dm_repl_tranhash: Returns information about transactions being replicated in a
transactional publication.
4. Sys.dm_repl_traninfo: Returns information on each replicated or change data capture
transaction.



7. HOW TO PERFORM MONITORING IN REPLICATION?
Undistributed commands: which displays how many commands or queries which are waiting to
move from distribution database to subscriber. It will also displays how much take to replicate
those commands from distributor to subscriber.
Monitoring Areas: Replication monitor and replication Maintaince jobs
Note: Verify \check the history whether data is moving from "Publisher to distributor" or
"Distributor to subscriber" and check "undistributed command"
Note: Perform regular index maintenance, update stats, reindex, on Replication system tables
just like you do for user tables.
MSmerge_contents
MSmerge_genhistory
MSmerge_tombstone
MSmerge_current_partition_mappings
MSmerge_past_partition_mappings


8. WHAT ARE THE SP AND TRIGGERS ARE USED IN REPLICATION?
Merge Replication:
Store Procedures:
dbo.MSmerge_del_sp_80FDDC450D814A6F4A371E97BB9A4ECC
dbo.MSmerge_ins_sp_80FDDC450D814A6F4A371E97BB9A4ECC
dbo.MSmerge_upd_sp_80FDDC450D814A6F4A371E97BB9A4ECC
dbo.MSmerge_sel_sp_80FDDC450D814A6F4A371E97BB9A4ECC
Triggers:
MSmerge_del_EDE22551187F43A2A520C328D819CF51
MSmerge_ins_EDE22551187F43A2A520C328D819CF51
MSmerge_upd_EDE22551187F43A2A520C328D819CF51

9. IF I CHANGE RECOVERY MODEL THEN IS THERE ANY IMPACT?
> There will be no impact if we change recovery models due to replication support all type of
recovery models.


10. DIFF BETWEEN PUSH AND PULL?
> Distributor agent resided in distribution server - Push type
> Distributor agent resided in subscriber server- Pull Type
11. CAN WE MODIFY DISTRIBUTION DATABASE DATA?
Yes we can modify distribution database but it effect replication. Not recommended
12. TRUNCATE TABLE IN PUBLISHER WILL IT’S EFFECT TO SUBSCRIBER?
> Truncate is a non-logged operation and it will not replicate automatically from publisher to
subscriber



13. ERROR NUMBERS?
14. PRIMARY KEY VIOLATION?
PRIMARY KEY VIOLATION:
Error messages:
Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_tablename'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object
'dbo.tablename'. (Source: MSSQLServer, Error number: 2627)


Impact: This type of error generally appears in Transaction replication type.
Replication sync gets fail if this error reported. data\transaction sends from publisher to
distributor. But from distributor to subscriber it fails and report the error in transactional
replication monitor.


Where to find:
> Go to replication monitor> All subscriptions column > Status column> double click> check the
information from publisher to distributor and dist> sub
> You can see error of primary key violation in dist to sub history.
From the error:


Transaction sequence no
Command ID:
Solution:
1. First find what transaction is inserted into subscriber which is causing this error by using
below commands and execute only on distribution database.
EXEC Distribution. Sp_browsereplcmds
@xact_seqno_start = ‘0x00000018000000A1000300000000’,
@xact_seqno_end = '0x00000018000000A1000300000000',
@command_id =1, @publisher_database_id = 1
2. COMMAND with transaction: {CALL [sp_MSins_dboetab] (N'3 ', N’c ', N’ap ')}
3. Delete manually from subscriber and monitor for some time.
4. Now replication is working with excellent performance with no latency value.



15. SHOULD I SCRIPT MY REPLICATION CONFIGURATION?
Yes. Scripting the replication configuration is a key part of any disaster recovery plan for a
replication topology


16. WHY DOES REPLICATION ADD A COLUMN TO REPLICATED TABLES; WILL IT BE REMOVED IF
THE TABLE ISN'T PUBLISHED?
> Merge replication adds the column rowguid to every table, unless the table already has a
column of data type unique identifier with the ROWGUIDCOL property set (in which case this
column is used). If the table is dropped from the publication, the rowguid column is removed; if
an existing column was used for tracking, the column is not removed.
Rowguid column: added in merge
MSrepl_tran_version: transactional updatable subscription

17. CAN MULTIPLE PUBLICATIONS USE THE SAME DISTRIBUTION DATABASE?
> Yes. There are no restrictions on the number or types of publications that can use the same
distribution database. All publications from a given Publisher must use the same Distributor and
distribution database.


18. DOES REPLICATION ENCRYPT DATA?
> No. Replication does not encrypt data that is stored in the database or transferred over the
network

19. WHY CAN'T I RUN TRUNCATE TABLE ON A PUBLISHED TABLE?
> TRUNCATE TABLE is a non-logged operation that does not fire trigger


20. IF I CHANGE RECOVERY MODEL THEN IS THERE ANY IMPACT?
No

21. HOW SNAPSHOT WILL BE TAKEN?
> In SQL Server replication data transfer happen by using method of “BCP [BULK COPY
PROGRAM] - for data, sch –for schema, Ind-for indexes move”


22. CAN WE MODIFY DISTRIBUTION DATABASE DATA?
> Yes we can modify the distribution database tables but not recommended...it will go to create
impact.


23. SCHEMA CHANGES IF WE DO ANY IMPACT TO SUBSCRIBER?
Steps:
> After schema changes in publisher article then we require to renationalize the snapshot agent
to generate new snapshot
> Go to subscriber and then renationalize to apply new snapshot into subscriber article.

Note1: In peer –to-peer replication automatically schema change replicate to subscriber
without snapshot agent run.
Note2: If we run snapshot then only modified data changes replicate to subscriber
