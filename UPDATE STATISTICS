> By default, the query optimizer already updates statistics as necessary to improve the query
plan in some cases you can improve query performance by using UPDATE STATISTICS
> Updating statistics ensures that queries compile with up-to-date statistics. However, updating
statistics causes queries to recompile. We recommend not updating statistics too frequently
because there is a performance tradeoff between improving query plans and the time it takes
to recompile queries

Note:
1. Update statistics is the one of the DBA Maintaince activity and runs every day after business
hours.
2. After rebuild index no need to perform again update statistics. Why because whenever index
runs automatically Update statistics also gets updated.
3. Whenever create any index, always first create STATISTICS and the create indexes.
