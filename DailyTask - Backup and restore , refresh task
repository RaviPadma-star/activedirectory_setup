Backups and restore:
new - query --> backup database adventures to disk = ' ad_full.bak'

--> backup database adv to disk = 'adv_diff.bak' with differentail
--> backup log adv to disk = 'adv_log.trn'

once you changed the simple to full recovery model , we need to take the full backup to apply the new recovery model

-- copy-on-backup
-- backup database adv to disk = 'adv.bak' with copy_only

Restore - fulll, diff, log -- serial only
imagine you have t10 logs backups- you have to restore with serial order

-- database - restore -device
  options check overite with database name for same database name
--check logs for error -- sql server logs
--> event viewer


Database refresh task:
--> refresh the database restore the db only
-- we take the backup of prod_db imagine sales

---> non prod restore in the non prod is called referesh db

--> prod sales (ravi, karthik) has access on producation db

-- for non prod server (karthik) has only here aceess --> old permission or gone they are overwritten
-- before restoring hte db
steps: go to nin prod take the permissions backup -- before restoring
restore the db from prod
resore the permission from step 1

live---> login --> new login for ravi karthik
before doing the db take the user persmiison scripts --> on non prod-server

open new query with advwork -- execute the scripts copy the output 
now restore the db 

now check with logins, it cant access the db because logins are missing 
now we have copied the output of user permisson scripts-- copyoutput
go to the server again , open new query paste the scripts--> run --refresh the db
now we able to access the db

-- in production only backup, other think you have to do on non-prod server
