File movement activities: [.MDF, .LDF & .NDF]
1. File move will applicable for both user and system databases.
USER DATABASE STEPS:
Pre-Activity: Take full database backup before performing any changes on your SQL Server
instance.
1. Collect logical file names for your databases [User and system]
sp_helpfile
2. Update the logical name for user database by using alter command with new path


Alter database dbname modify file (name='logical file name', filename='newpath') -----Data file
Alter database dbname modify file (name='logical file name', filename='newpath') -----log file


Note: Verify whether logical name is updated with new path by using sp_helpfile again...


3. Take database offline. [Kill the session if any active sessions are running on the database
before taking your user database offline]

4. Move physical files to new path and bring the user database online.

Note: While moving physical .mdf, .ldf, .ndf files use always copy & paste method but not cut
and paste.
5. Sp_helpfile
Note: When performing user database file movement only required to take database offline but
not SQL Server services offline

Note: Ask application team to check the connectivity of the database and once received
confirmation from application team then only delete the older files from physical location.

Note: After completing the file movement go and clear the older files from directory by using
SHIFT+DELETE but not delete ...since if you use delete next go to recycle bin folder if space is
not there in C:\ drive then server becomes hung state. More risk is involve
