MEMORY ISSUE
How to find SQL Server actual memory utilization?
Steps: 1. Go to task manager> check SQLsrv.exe or SSMS.exe how much memory utilizing.

2. If any other .exe is using more Memory then inform to relevant team. If SQL Server is
consuming then go to SSMS> try to check any spid consuming more memory by using
Select * from sys.sysprocesses
3. If example: is Sql server is consuming 20 GB out of total 24 GB physical memory, then how to
find actual utilization from Sql end.
By using, DBCC memory status
Find Value or parameter: STOLEN POTENTIAL [Shows free memory from SQL level]
CONVERT VALUE INTO: VALUE*8 /1024/1024= Actual free memory out of total SQL Server
consumed memory.
19 GB free out of SQL Server memory 20 GB.


4. Please check whether memory capping or restriction is done at SQL Server level.
5. If not please inform apps team to raise Change record and you provide suggestion how much
memory capping to be set dedicatedly for SQL Server.
Always keep 80% of memory Sql server and rest of 20 % of memory to o\s out of total physical
memory.
6. Still memory issue, then enable the memory related counters to find the standard values.
7. Verify the execution plans and sometimes query optimizer may prepare wrong plans which
leads to high CPU and high memory
To clear the plans
DBCC FREEPROCCACHE---It clear all the plans from buffer pool
Note: plz get approval from application team before performs the cache clear
