Performance monitor:
This is one of tool in built in SQL Server and the main purpose is to capture resource utilization
in SQL Server in terms of CPU,

MEMORY, DISK I\O and network

1. MEMORY COUNTERS:
1. Page life Expectancy:
This counter tells how much time page residing in the buffer pool is nothing but Page life
Expectancy.
The standard value should be greater than 300.


2. Lazy Writes/Sec:
This counter tracks how many times a second that the Lazy Writer process is moving dirty pages
from the buffer to disk in order to free up buffer space.
Note: Generally speaking, this should not be a high value, say more than 20 per second or so


3. Checkpoint Pages/Sec: When a checkpoint occurs, all dirty pages are written to disk. This is a
normal procedure and will cause this counter to rise during the checkpoint process.
Note: Default automatic check point value is 3 sec

4. Page reads/sec: Number of physical database page reads issued. 80 – 90 per second is
normal. Anything value more then leads to memory pressure.

5. Page writes/sec: Number of physical database page writes issued. 80 – 90 per second is
normal. Anything value more than leads to memory pressure.


8. Buffer Cache hit ratio: Percentage of pages that were found in the buffer pool without
having to incur a read from disk.
Standard value is always >90%

9. Target Server Memory (KB): Total amount of dynamic memory the server can consume.
10. Total Server Memory (KB): Total amount of dynamic memory (in kilobytes) that the server is
using currently

2. DISK COUNTERS:
1. Avg. Disk Sec/Read: Measure of disk latency. Avg. Disk sec/Read is the average time to read
data from disk
Excellent < 08 Msec (.008 seconds)
Good < 12 Msec (.012 seconds)
Fair < 20 Msec (.020 seconds)
Poor > 20 Msec (.020 seconds)
