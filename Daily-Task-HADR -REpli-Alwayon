Replication: Replicate the articles between the publisher and suscriber
  we called server as 
  --> publisher
  distributer
  subscriber

  replication wiil be run based on the agents and jobs
  --> snap shot agent
  --> log reader agent
  --> Distributer agent
  --> merge agent

  --> how to monitor using via distributor replication
  --> go to instance --> replication right click-> launch replication monitor
  --> if you see not sync option right click and astart

  agent-- right click on agents view details
  -- agent profile

  --> how to get latency on transaction replication--> traces tokens tab insert traces
  --> what is trace tokens
      carefully while starting the snapshot agents
  --> some times we get request for addig artices in replication
  --> instance -replication -> in which reolication you have to add articles for ex: snapshot replication right click properties --articles tab --go to secondary check wheather the artickes are added or not, it will not add
  immeaditely because snapshot is a scheduled --> if you want immeadetaily effect means  go to monitor- select snapshot agents simply run the agents
--> if you want add article to transaction replica the mandotory this -- primary key
  --ill use import and export method to move the table to one and another table


  CLustering:
  in cluster we called as primarynode and secondary node --
  for errors -- if we want need to see cluster events and information details
  --> evetn viewer-- eventvwr
  how many ip address are need to configure clustering
  shout out questins: how many nodes and application  2n + 1 

  node 1 public and private ip
  node 2 public and private ip
  1 windows cluster ip
  1 sql cluster ip


  ALWAYS ON:
  --> HOW TO ADD A NEW DB ag
  LETS CREATE the table, if you want add to ag
-- meet the conditions:
  1.db should be full recovvery mode
  2. take full backup
   go to availibilty databse- right click add db -- take the full backup, which db you want add, take the log backup of db as well

  --> some time in ag, db suspended kind of this
-->how can i track--> click on alwayson--right click- show dashboard we can see wizard, click on error view always on health checks -- latest error will be bottom
  -> now go to susoended databse rgiht click - resume data movements

  some times we get request for refresh db: for ag groups
  ________________________________________________________

  step 1:  remove db from Ag, script out the permsioon, restore full backuo on primary replica, which we taken from the production server
  -- then imagine , 2  secondary server replicas are there -> then again take the full and log backup of primary db
  then restore the all permissions
  then take  full backup, log backuo and log backup primary server after resoring the permissons
    -> restore with no recovery in all secondary replicas
    --> then add db base to ag setup

    --> now customer is asking give permission on a tbale on database:
    --> go to instance -- securtiy logins- to give access -- first of all i have to creatre the login- new login- sql password
    i want make karthik sys-admins go to server roles - sysadmins
    --> you want to give permission on db level then go ti user mapping, here select which databse you want and what kind of db role ex: data_writer
      --> if some one account is locaked how to unlock--> go to login-> select login name--> double click-- stauts-tab- sql server auth--> uncheck
